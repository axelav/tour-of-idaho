can leave a vehicle at [TA RV park in Sagle](https://www.campgroundreviews.com/regions/idaho/sagle/travel-america-rv-park-4064).
this might be a good spot to leave a truck on way there at start of the trip.

## general trip notes

> I keep daily logs that consist of not much more than the basics: Day, Date,
> Miles, Location, Weather, and anything interesting I experienced or thought
> about.

## T1 details & suggestions

longest distance between fuel: 230 miles (twice)

> The best way to prepare for Tour navigation in advance is to reconcile our
> route waypoints with our maps, the route book and any notes that you make from
> observing our waypoints on Google Earth. You may then create your own route
> file from our waypoints to follow if you'd like, but that's actually more work
> than needed and may actually degrade your ability to navigate when you get
> here. We recommend that you simply add waypoints to ours as you see fit while
> studying the route (without overdoing it), upload everything to your GPS, and
> then use your GPS to navigate from waypoint to waypoint with maps as a backup.
> The reason for this is that every trail map we've used for the Tour is wrong
> in some places. It's inevitable. Trails change all of the time and keeping up
> is a problem for any map maker. Our waypoints are where then need to be and
> are accurate. If our waypoint looks like it's a quarter of a mile off of the
> trail on the map you are looking at I can all but guarantee that our waypoint
> is right and the map is wrong.

### tips from [Jimmy Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haKrgV0wmFY)

- don't get wrapped up in trying to go fast
- study the maps. learn how to read maps. if in doubt, stop, pull out maps &
  figure out where you are.
- there are never intentionally misleading waypoints.
- roll up & bring Idaho Delorme atlas
